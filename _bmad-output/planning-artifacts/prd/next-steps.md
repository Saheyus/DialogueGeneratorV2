# Next Steps

1. **Integrate into PRD:** Merge this enhanced FR list into main PRD document
2. **Update NFRs:** Add performance targets moved from FRs (generation time, rendering speed, API latency)
3. **Epic Breakdown:** Use these 113 FRs as capability contract for story creation
4. **Testing:** Each FR becomes testable acceptance criteria
